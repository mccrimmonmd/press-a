- Add gravity and air resistance to "cannon" confetti
- Adjust confetti density based on window width
- Adjust cannon spread based on window width
- Sounds (e.g. button presses, victory fanfare)
- Streamers (and other types of "alternate" confetti)
- Have confetti rotate in 3D? (Might be good practice)
