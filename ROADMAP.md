- There should be a "pop" of some kind when you first win--a confetti burst
centered on the mouse, perhaps, or shooting up from the corners before falling.

- Streamers (and other types of "alternate" confetti)

- Sounds (e.g. button presses, victory fanfare)

- Have confetti rotate in 3D? (Might be good practice)
